It has been a long time since I updated my blog last time. I came across the concept of "Explaining Away" when I was studying Belief Network. I had a very difficult time trying to understand this concept and the reason why it will cause deep belief network hard to train.

Here is my understanding of "Explaining Away" given Hinton's example in his course materials in the "Neural Networks for Machine Learning" course.
