# Introduction

Since I am hosting my own websites, I sometimes have to prepare some png-formatted images with the right size for my website. So I developed this [Image Resizer](http://imageresizer.pythonanywhere.com/) web application using Python in two days, and hosted it on PythonAnywhere. This is formally my first experience of developing web applications, and I think I have learned a lot.

# Mannual

This is the Image Resizer Web Application Interface. It is extremely simple and advertisement free. You will just have to select your image file, select the resizing mode (use width and height / use ratio), and input your parameter. The Image Resizer could enlarge or shrink the images. But the performance of shrinking images is the best. After submitting the image and parameters, you will be allowed to download the image resized in png format.
