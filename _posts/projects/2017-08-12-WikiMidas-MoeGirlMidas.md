### Introduction

[WikiMidas](https://github.com/leimao/WikiMidas) is a Python spidering API wrapper program specifically designed for data crawling from MediaWiki APIs (https://www.mediawiki.org/). It could be used to retrieve information from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and MoeGirl (https://zh.moegirl.org/Mainpage) which uses MediaWiki as their APIs. MoeGirl is more focused on the articles in the finctional characters' in anime. [MoeGirlMidas], developed based on WikiMidas, are designed specifically to retrieve characters' data from MoeGirl.

I named the two programs after "midas". Because I like the "feel" that you touch something and something becomes useful.
