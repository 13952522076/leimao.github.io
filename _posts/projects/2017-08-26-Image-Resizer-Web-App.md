# Introduction

Since I am hosting my own websites, I sometimes have to prepare some png-formatted images with the right size for my website. So I developed this [Image Resizer](http://imageresizer.pythonanywhere.com/) web application using Python and hosted it on PythonAnywhere. This is formally my first experience of developing web applications, and I think I have learned a lot.
